/* Week 1 Assignment
Design an algorithm to find the weighted average of six test scores and the weighted average of six assignment scores
and then get the master average between the two weighted averages.

The six test scores and their respective weights are given in the following format: 

75  0.10
95  0.20
85  0.25
55  0.25
65  0.10 
70  0.10
The six assignment scores and their respective weights are given in the following format: 

55  0.05
65  0.10
65  0.15
60  0.25
55  0.25 
50  0.20
Please send me the source code you designed.*/

		System.out.println("Your Total Course Average Is " + ((testWeightedAvg + assignmentWeightedAvg)/2));
